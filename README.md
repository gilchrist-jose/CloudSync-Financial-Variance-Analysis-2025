## 📈 Analytical Framework

### Variance Methodology

**Calculated Metrics:**
- Dollar Variance: `Actual - Budget`
- Percentage Variance: `(Actual - Budget) / Budget`
- Variance Classification (helper column): Context-dependent logic
  - Revenue: Positive variance = Favorable
  - Expenses: Negative variance = Favorable
  -  *Used for data validation and potential filtering*

**Analysis Dimensions:**
- Temporal: Monthly, YTD
- Organizational: Department, Category
- Granularity: Summary → Category → Account detail

**Pivot Table Architecture:**
1. P&L Summary (Category level performance)
2. Time Series (Monthly trend analysis)
3. Department Attribution (Accountability view)
4. Category Deep-Dive (Expense driver identification)
5. Account Detail (Top 15 variance contributors)
